<!-- <html>
    html----
    html tag is  the structural    tag and it is not always necessary to write -----
    <head>
        head ---
        all the meta  that doesn't  necessarily needed to be rendered there on the website but  it should be there 
        are written inside head tag , for example -title 
        title ---
        whatever we write here in the title tag is written on the website's top like other than  domain name the thing that appear after the website is working ---
        <title> Notes</title>

    </head>
    <body>
        body----
        this contains all actual meat of the code 
        <div style = "background-color: rgb(240, 119, 119);">
            <div> 
                hello (the only difference in div and a span is that span takes only the space enough to fit the filled content )
            <div> 
                hello2 ( div takes up whole space in that line  )
            </div>
            <span>
                hello 
            </span>
            <span>
                hello2
            </span>
        </div>
    </body>

<!-- 
 some tags 
 <h1> hi there </h1>
 <h2> hi there </h2>
 <h3> hi there </h3>
 <h4> hi there </h4> 
 <h5> hi there </h5>
 <h6> hi there </h6> !-->
 <!-- <div>
    hi there 
 </div>
 <center> 
     <img src="landing.svg"></img>
 </center> -->
 <!--  it put the image in the center , basically center tag puts the thnings in the senter  -->
<!-- attributes  ( anchor tag will have many attributes which we can use inside it ) <a> ( anchor )  tag  - - what ever href written inside the attribute tag  , on click  we can go to someother webpage -  that text will have a link because of href 
     target attribut - _self: Opens the linked document in the same frame or window as the current document. This is the default behavior if no target attribute is specified.
        _blank: Opens the linked document in a new window or tab.
        _parent: Opens the linked document in the parent frame. This is relevant in the context of nested frames (though frames are largely deprecated in modern HTML).
        _top: Opens the linked document in the full body of the window, breaking out of any frames. -->

<!-- bold and ittalic - make the font bold  -->

<!-- <b> this is bold hye i am gaurav </b>
<i> this is  italic hi there </i>
<button> hi there </button> 
for creating button we use button tag 

<input placeholder = "username" type = "text"/>

ATTRIBUTES

these things add extra things to some tag  , each tag can have multiple attributes , which actally defines what that tag should do 
 for exameple  - <img src = "a.png">
                <a href = "google.com"> lol</a>
                <button onClick=" "></button>


here href , src , onClick , id etc..  all are the attributes
